## objectDetection_ComputerVision

This directory contains a pythonn script that performs object detection on images, video saved to disk and real-time detection using the webcam on the user's machine.

OpenCV was used to perform object detection, with models trained on the Microsoft's COCO dataset (https://viso.ai/computer-vision/coco-dataset/)

The document has been commented extensively to provide additional clarity.
